# Introduction to GeoPandas and related vector geospatial processing with FOSS Python

This [Maptime Meetup workshop (Feb. 8, 2017)](https://www.meetup.com/MaptimeSEA/) is adapted from materials prepared by [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) for the [University of Washington GeoHack week event](https://geohackweek.github.io), Nov 14-18, 2016. We'll be using [those materials ("Vector Data Processing using Python Tools")](https://geohackweek.github.io/vector/) directly in some cases, as is.

Information about all materials is available at these two documents:

- [Materials and Lessons](lessons.md)
- [Python Conda environment](install-conda.md)
